# This file contains properties that are common to the various subprojects
# of the rt-closed/tests directory.  It will be included automatically by the
# build-defs.xml file *before* importing the subproject's project.properties
# file, meaning that any properties specified in this file will
# take precedence over those in the subproject's project.properties file and
# the common.properties file.
