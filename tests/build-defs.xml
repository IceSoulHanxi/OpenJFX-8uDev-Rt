      Defines common properties and macros for JavaFX rt-closed/tests dir.
      Sub-projects should import this file into their build.xml file.
      This file will import all other necessary top repository build-*.xml files.

    <!--
        Note that .properties files are loaded relative to the basedir of
        the caller script, i.e., the <component>/<subproject>/build.xml file.  The order
        is important here:
         1. First set a couple properties that are referenced by the
            subproject's project.properties file when building javac.classpath
            and other properties.
         2. Load the subproject's project.properties file to set up
            classpath properties and any other properties that will override
            the default values defined in common.properties.
         3. Load the common.properties file, which includes default values
            of properties common to most/all subprojects.

    <property file="../../common.properties"/>
